# React_Restaurant_finder
Dependencies
npm install


I keept track of the exact time spent on this problem (2hrs 55 mins). The most challenging part was ensuring that the infinite scrolling functionality seamlessly integrated with the existing code structure and UI components.

Trade-offs:

I chose to prioritize implementing the infinite scrolling feature and handling user input for changing the query term. These were essential requirements for the project.
I focused on providing a basic implementation of the user interface, ensuring it's functional and easy to use. I didn't spend time on elaborate UI designs or animations to keep the scope manageable.
Improvements:
I ensured error handling for cases where the restaurant object is undefined, preventing potential crashes.
I provided comments and clear variable names to enhance code readability and maintainability.
I could further optimize the code for performance and efficiency, especially when loading more results from the Yelp API, by implementing pagination instead of fetching all results at once.
I could add caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve app responsiveness.
I could enhance the UI with more interactive features, such as swiping animations or gestures for navigation.
I could add filtering options to refine search results based on user preferences.
I could implement testing to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.


When I was adding a file in GitHub I just remove the assets folder as it was not required but after that I realized that it has an app icon but only warning will come Just Ignore it.
